# Mnenmonics

Generally, we recommend that users use an instance of the Mnemonic struct for working with Mnemonics.

## Create new Mnemonic

```rust
use walletd_bip39::{Mnemonic};
```
```rust
let mnemonic = Mnemonic::builder().generate();
```

You can create a new Mnemonic by initialising an instance of the Mnemonic struct as follows:
```rust
let mnemonic = Mnemonic::new(); // returns a new mnemonic seed
```

## Restoring from mnemonic phrase

To get a Mnemonic instance for an existing mnemonic phrase, including those generated by other software or hardware wallets, use Mnemonic::from_phrase().

You will need the following import:

```rust
use walletd_bip39::{Language, Mnemonic};
```

```rust
let my_phrase: &str = "onion work ....";
let language = Language::English;
let specified_phrase: &str = "mypassword"; // If you want to use a passphrase, otherwise:
let specified_phrase = None; // If you don't want to use a password

let mnemonic = Mnemonic::from_phrase(
      language,
      phrase: &str,
      specified_passphrase: Option<&str>
    ); // returns a new mnemonic seed
```

WalletD suggests using the builder interface for instantiating new instances
