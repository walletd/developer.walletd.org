# WalletD KeyPair

WalletD is a cryptocurrency wallet library that encapsulates Rust-based functionality for various different cryptocurrencies and blockchains.
It contains features to handle creating and importing wallets, checking balances, and sending and receiving transactions.
It aims to provide a common interface for interacting with different cryptocurrencies and blockchains.
WalletD is being built to facilitate and simplify development and implementation of multi-cryptocurrency non-custodial wallets. This resource provides documentation related the high-level KeyPair in walletD. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## `KeyPair` Struct
	 Holds info about a mnemonic type and the associated seed and phrase as well as the network type.
	 Enables the creation of a HD wallet from a mnemonic phrase that could be used with multiple cryptocurrencies.

### `KeyPair` Struct Methods

- `new() -> Self` 
	 -	 Creates a new KeyPair struct

- `builder() -> KeyPairBuilder` 
	 -	 Returns a new KeyPairBuilder struct with default options, allows use of builder pattern to specify options

- `mnemonic_seed(&self) -> Seed` 
	 -	 Returns the mnemonic seed as a `Seed` type

- `mnemonic_phrase(&self) -> &str` 
	 -	 Returns mnemonic phrase as a &str type

- `passphrase(&self) -> Option<&str>` 
	 -	 Returns passphrase as a Option\<&str\> type

- `to_master_key(&self) -> HDKey` 
	 -	 Returns the master HD key

- `network_type(&self) -> HDNetworkType` 
	 -	 Returns the HD network type

- `style(&self) -> MnemonicKeyPairType` 
	 -	 Returns the mnemonic key pair type (`MnemonicKeyPairType`)

- `derive_wallet<T>(&self) -> Result<T, Error>`
	 -	 Derives a wallet of the specified generic type T from the `KeyPair` struct
	 T must implement the CryptoWallet trait

## `MnemonicKeyPairType` Enum
	 Used to specify the type of mnemonic phrase associated with a `KeyPair` struct.

   Fields have info on:
   - The style of the mnemonic phrase
	 - The mnemonic seed (derived from the mnemonic phrase as well as the optional passphrase)
	 - The mnemonic phrase
	 - The optional passphrase
	 - The HD network type

### `MnemonicKeyPairType` Variants	 
  - `HDBip39`
	  - The mnemonic phrase is a BIP39 phrase and is affiliated with a HD wallet

## `KeyPairBuilder` Struct
	 A builder for the `KeyPair` struct, can be used is used specify options for and build a `KeyPair` struct.
   Fields have info on:
    -	 Option to set the mnemomonic phrase
	  - Option to set the mnemonic seed
	  - Option to set the passphrase
	  - Option to set the network type
	  - Option to set the mnemonic key pair type
	 
### `KeyPairBuilder` Struct Methods

- `new() -> Self `
	 - Creates a new KeyPairBuilder struct with the default options

- `mnemonic_phrase(&mut self, mnemonic_phrase: String) -> &mut Self` 
	 -	 Specifies the mnemonic phrase

- `mnemonic_seed(&mut self, mnemonic_seed: Seed) -> &mut Self` 
	 -	 Specifies the mnemonic seed

- `passphrase(&mut self, passphrase: String) -> &mut Self` 
	 -	 Specifies the passphrase

- `network_type(&mut self, network_type: HDNetworkType) -> &mut Self` 
	 -	 Specifies the network type

- `style(&mut self, style: MnemonicKeyPairType) -> &mut Self` 
	 -	 Specifies the mnemonic phrase key pair type

- `no_mnemonic_phrase(&mut self) -> &mut Self` 
	 -	 Sets the mnemonic phrase to None, unspecifies the mnemonic phrase if it had previously been specified on the same builder

- `no_mnemonic_seed(&mut self) -> &mut Self` 
	 -	 Sets the mnemonic seed to None, unspecifies the mnemonic seed if it had previously been specified on the same builder

- `no_passphrase(&mut self) -> &mut Self` 
	 -	 Sets the passphrase to None, unspecifies the passphrase if it had previously been specified on the same builder

- `build(&mut self) -> Result<KeyPair, Error>` 
	 -	 Builds the KeyPair struct, returns an error if neither the mnemonic phrase nor the mnemonic seed was specified
