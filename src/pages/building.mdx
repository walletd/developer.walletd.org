If you wish to build WalletD from source code, for whatever reason, you can follow the steps below:

1. Clone the walletd repository using Git:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/walletd/walletd.git
```
1. Build the project using Cargo:
1. cd walletd
1. cargo build --release

The resulting library will be located in the target/release directory.
