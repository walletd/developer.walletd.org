# Bitcoin Wallet


 The BitcoinWallet struct is the main entry point to access walletD functionality for Bitcoin.
 
 ## Import from Seed

 Here's how you can access a bitcoin wallet based on a master Seed.
 The Seed can be derived from a Mnemonic using the Mnemonic::to_seed method.
```rust

 use walletd_bitcoin::prelude::*;
 use walletd_hd_key::prelude::*;
 let master_seed = Seed::from_str("a2fd9c0522d84d52ee4c8533dc02d4b69b4df9b6255e1af20c9f1d4d691689f2a38637eb1ec778972bf845c32d5ae83c7536999b5666397ac32021b21e0accee")?;
 let network_type = HDNetworkType::TestNet;
 let master_hd_key = HDKey::new_master(master_seed, network_type)?;
 let mut btc_wallet = BitcoinWallet::builder().master_hd_key(master_hd_key).build()?;
 ```

 ## Default Derivation Path

 Deriving a BitcoinWallet is simple and uses some default settings under the hood.
 When using BitcoinWalletBuilder, the default settings set the AddressType as 'P2wpkh`bitcoin::AddressType::P2wpkh and the corresponding default HDPurpose for the derivation path is set as HDPurpose::BIP49.
```rust

 use walletd_bitcoin::bitcoin;
   assert_eq!(btc_wallet.address_format(), bitcoin::AddressType::P2wpkh);
   assert_eq!(btc_wallet.hd_path_builder().purpose, Some(HDPurpose::BIP84.to_shortform_num()));

```

 ## Using Blockstream 

 The BitcoinWallet struct can be used to access blockchain data through a BlockchainConnector such as Blockstream.
 The Blockstream instance can be used on its own to access blockchain data such as fee estimates.
 It can be affiliated with a BitcoinWallet to enable the BitcoinWallet to access blockchain data and send transactions.
```rust

 let btc_client = Blockstream::new("https://blockstream.info/testnet/api")?;
 let fee_estimates = btc_client.fee_estimates().await?;
 println!("fee estimates: {:?}", fee_estimates);
 btc_wallet.set_blockchain_client(btc_client);
 ```

 ## Sync BitcoinWallet

 The BitcoinWallet struct can be used to sync the wallet with the blockchain and load the associated BitcoinAddresses.
```rust

 let btc_client = Blockstream::new("https://blockstream.info/testnet/api")?;
 let fee_estimates = btc_client.fee_estimates().await?;
 println!("fee estimates: {:?}", fee_estimates);
 btc_wallet.set_blockchain_client(btc_client);
 for addr in btc_wallet.associated_info() {
     println!("address: {}, derivation path {}",
     addr.address.public_address(), addr.hd_key().derivation_path().to_string());
 }
 println!("next receive address: {}", btc_wallet.receive_address()?);
 println!("next change address: {}", btc_wallet.next_change_address()?.public_address());



 let balance = btc_wallet.balance().await?;
 println!(
     "bitcoin wallet balance: {} BTC, ({} satoshi",
     balance.btc(),
     balance.satoshi()
 );
