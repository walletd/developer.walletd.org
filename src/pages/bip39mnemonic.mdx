# BIP39 Mnemonic

[walletd_bip39 Rust library crate](https://crates.io/crates/walletd_bip39)

## Quickstart
A quick way to access the different features related to the BIP39 mnemonic in this walletD library is to make use of the Bip39Mnemonic builder (Bip39MnemonicBuilder) which can be also be accessed with the default settings through `Bip39Mnemonic::builder()`.

The default specifications for the Bip39MnemonicBuilder are: English language, 12 words in the mnemonic phrase, and no passphrase specified.
You can get the mnemonic seed from the [Bip39Mnemonic] struct using the [`to_seed`][Bip39Mnemonic::to_seed] method.

Here's how you can create a new randomly generated BIP39 mnemonic using the default specifications.
```rust
use walletd_bip39::prelude::*;

let mnemonic = Bip39Mnemonic::builder().build()?;
// display the generated mnemonic phrase
println!("mnemonic phrase: {}", mnemonic.phrase());
// can use the hex format specifier to print the seed as hex
println!("mnemonic seed hex: {:x}", mnemonic.to_seed());
// can use the as_bytes method to get the seed as a byte array
println!("mnemonic seed as bytes: {:?}", mnemonic.to_seed().as_bytes());
```

You can override the default specifications by providing your desired specifications to the builder.
You can also reuse the Bip39MnemonicBuilder object in a mutable way to create multiple BIP39 mnemonics and even override previous specifications.
```rust
let mut mnemonic_builder = Bip39Mnemonic::builder();

// specify that the mnemonic phrase should consist of 24 words
let mnemonic_1 = mnemonic_builder.mnemonic_type(Bip39MnemonicType::Words24).build()?;
println!("mnemonic_1 phrase: {}", mnemonic_1.phrase());
println!("mnemonic_1 seed hex: {:x}", mnemonic_1.to_seed());
// see the number of entropy bits for the specified mnemonic type
println!("mnemonic_1 number of entropy bits: {}", mnemonic_1.mnemonic_type().entropy_bits());

// reuse builder but now specify 18 words in the mnemonic phrase
let mnemonic_2 = mnemonic_builder.mnemonic_type(Bip39MnemonicType::Words18).build()?;
println!("mnemonic_2 phrase: {}", mnemonic_2.phrase());
println!("mnemonic_2 seed hex: {:x}", mnemonic_2.to_seed());
println!("mnemonic_2 number of entropy bits: {}", mnemonic_2.mnemonic_type().entropy_bits());

```

It may be useful in some cases to provide all of the specifications even when using the some of the default settings.

You can specify a passphrase to use when generating the mnemonic.
Note that the same passphrase must be used when recovering the mnemonic.

**Warning:**
If a Bip39Mnemonic mnemonic phrase is generated using a specification of passphrase, both the mnemonic phrase and the passphrase is required to recover the Bip39Mnemonic.
The specified passphrase is not stored in the Bip39Mnemonic struct. It is important to store the passphrase you specified securely as well as the mnemonic phrase to enable recovery of the Bip39Mnemonic.

```rust
let mnemonic_3 = Bip39Mnemonic::builder().passphrase("mypassphrase").mnemonic_type(Bip39MnemonicType::Words12).language(Bip39Language::English).build()?;
println!("mnemonic_3 phrase: {}", mnemonic_3.phrase());
println!("mnemonic_3 seed hex: {:x}", mnemonic_3.to_seed());
```

A Bip39Mnemonic can be restored from a specified valid mnemonic phrase or from a specified valid mnemonic phrase and passphrase if a passphrase was specified when the mnemonic was generated.

```rust
let mnemonic_phrase = "outer ride neither foil glue number place usage ball shed dry point";
let restored_mnemonic_1 = Bip39Mnemonic::builder().mnemonic_phrase(mnemonic_phrase).build()?;
println!("restored_mnemonic_1 phrase: {}", restored_mnemonic_1.phrase());
println!("restored_mnemonic_1 seed hex: {:x}", restored_mnemonic_1.to_seed());

let specified_passphrase = "mypassphrase";
let restored_mnemonic_2 = Bip39Mnemonic::builder().mnemonic_phrase(mnemonic_phrase).passphrase(specified_passphrase).build()?;
println!("restored_mnemonic_2 phrase: {}", restored_mnemonic_2.phrase());
println!("restored_mnemonic_2 seed hex: {:x}", restored_mnemonic_2.to_seed());
```

## Bip39Mnemonic
 Represents a Bip39 mnemonic.

 ### Examples

 To create a *new* Bip39Mnemonic from a randomly generated key, call
 Bip39Mnemonic::new().
```rust

 //let mnemonic = Bip39Mnemonic::new(Bip39MnemonicType::Words12, Bip39Language::English, "");
 ```


 To get a Bip39Mnemonic instance for an existing mnemonic phrase,
 including those generated by other software or hardware wallets, use
 Bip39Mnemonic::from_phrase().


 Alternatively, the Bip39MnemonicBuilder struct can be used
 to create a Bip39Mnemonic struct by only specifying the options
 needed, allowing for options to be rewritten. The
 Bip39MnemonicBuilder struct with default options can be
 created using the Bip39Mnemonic::builder() function.

 You can get the HD wallet Seed object from a Bip39Mnemonic object by
 calling [to_seed()][Bip39Mnemonic::to_seed()] on the object. From there you can either get the raw
 byte value with [as_bytes()][Seed::as_bytes()], or the hex
 representation using Rust formatting: `format!("{:X}", seed)`.


###  new() -> Self 
 Generates a new mnemonic given the language, length of mnemonic, and
 optional passphrase

###  from_phrase() -\> Result\<Self, Error\> 
 Restores a mnemonic from a mnemonic phrase and optional passphrase,
 requires specifying the language

###  detect_language() -\> Result\<Self::Mnemonic, Self::ErrorType\> 
 Restores a mnemonic from a mnemonic phrase and optional passphrase,
 automatically detects the language

###  to_seed(&self) -> Seed 
 Provides the Seed object

###  phrase(&self) -> String 
 Gets the phrase

###  language(&self) -> Bip39Language 
 Gets the lang field data

###  mnemonic_type(&self) -> Bip39MnemonicType 
 Gets the mnemonic_type data

## Bip39MnemonicBuilder
 Implements the builder pattern for
 creating a Bip39Mnemonic struct.

 The builder pattern allows for the
 creation of a Bip39Mnemonic struct by only specifying the options
 needed, allowing for options to be rewritten.
 The Bip39MnemonicBuilder struct with default options can be
 created using the `Bip39Mnemonic::builder()` function or
 `Bip39MnemonicBuilder::new()`. The default trait is
 implemented for MnemonicBuilder with the language set to English, the
 mnemonic type set to 12 words, and the other fields not set.

 The Bip39MnemonicBuilder::generate() function
 will create a new mnemonic and return a Bip39Mnemonic struct.
 The Bip39MnemonicBuilder::restore() function will
 restore a mnemonic from a mnemonic phrase or seed and return a
 Bip39Mnemonic struct. The Bip39MnemonicBuilder::build() is a versatile function that can be used both cases when generating a new mnemonic as well as when restoring a mnemonic.
 Various builder methods can be used to specify
 the options for the mnemonic.
 The MnemonicBuilder::detect_language() function can be used to specify that the language should be automatically detected from the mnemonic phrase.


###  new() -> Self 
 Creates new builder struct with default values

###  restore(&self) -\> Result\<Self::Mnemonic, Self::ErrorType\> 
 Restore a mnemonic struct from a specified phrase or seed.
 It's recommended to restore a mnemonic struct from the phrase rather
 than a seed. Other optional parameters can be specified to ensure
 that the recovered mnemonic matches the specifications. This
 includes the language, mnemonic type, and passphrase. If a phrase is
 provided, the language and mnemonic type will be derived from the
 phrase, but an error will be reported if the language or mnemonic
 type specified do not match the language or mnemonic type derived
 from the phrase. If a passphrase is provided along with the mnemonic
 phrase, the seed will be derived from the mnemonic phrase and
 encrypted using the passphrase. If both a mnemonic phrase and a seed
 are provided, the specified seed will be ignored and only the mnemonic
 phrase will be used to construct the Mnemonic struct with no checks in
 place to compare with the specified seed. If a seed is directly
 provided without a phrase being specified, the mnemonic will we
 recovered using the seed info and the specifications for the language
 and mnemonic type, there are defaults in place for the language and
 mnemonic type. It is assumed that the seed provided is the
 "unencrypted" seed. That means that if a seed is provided and a
 passphrase is also provided, the final seed stored to the mnemonic
 struct will be the "encrypted" seed with the mnemonic phrase stemming
 directly from the "unencrypted" seed. The seed stored to the
 Mnemonic struct will be the final one which is used to derive the
 private key. If a seed is provided without a passphrase, the seed
 will be stored as the final seed and a mnemonic phrase will be derived
 based on the options that were specified or are default for the language
 and mnemonic type.

###  generate(&self) -\> Result\<Self::Mnemonic, Self::ErrorType\> 
 Generate a new mnemonic which follows given specifications

###  build(&self) -\> Result\<Self::Mnemonic, Self::ErrorType\> 
 Build a mnemonic struct based on the specifications provided
