#### How to initialise an Ethereum wallet
EthClient is mentioned here as EthereumWallet requires an instance of EthClient to be initialised. For more info, refer to the [BlockChain Connector API](Test)

```rust
let mnemonic_phrase: &str =
  "outer ride ... dry point";
let passphrase: Option<&str> = Some("mypassphrase");
let restored_mnemonic =
    Mnemonic::from_phrase(Language::English, mnemonic_phrase, passphrase).unwrap();
let seed = restored_mnemonic.to_seed();

println!("seed as bytes: {:?}", seed.as_bytes());

let wallet = match EthereumWallet::builder().with_mnemonic_seed(seed).with_network_type(HDNetworkType::TestNet).build() 
{
    Ok(wallet) => Ok(wallet),
    Err(e) => Err(e),
};
```
