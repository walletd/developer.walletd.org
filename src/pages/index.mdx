# WalletD API Documentation

⚠️ This project is under heavy development. Expect bugs & breaking changes prior to v1.0.0's release.

## What is WalletD?

WalletD is an ecosystem designed to make using different cryptocurrencies easy. Built in Rust, we plan to make our [official crates](https://crates.io/crates/walletd) available for use on multiple platforms through the use of WASM libraries.

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, create a new application in your [developer settings](#), then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go live, publish it to our [integrations directory](#) to reach the Protocol community. {{ className: 'lead' }}
