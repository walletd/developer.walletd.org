# WalletD API Documentation

WalletD is a Rust-based cryptocurrency library designed to facilitate working with different cryptocurrencies in an intuitive way. It implements functionality designed to allow developers to work with a number of cryptocurrencies in a standardised way.

WalletD is a cryptocurrency wallet library that encapsulates Rust-based functionality for various different cryptocurrencies and blockchains. It contains features to handle creating and importing wallets, checking balances, and sending and receiving transactions. It ultimately aims to provide a common interface for interacting with significantly different cryptocurrencies and their blockchains.
