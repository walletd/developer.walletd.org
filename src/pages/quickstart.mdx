# Quickstart  

This guide will help you get set up and ready to use the WalletD Rust Library. 
We'll cover how to install Rust, add [walletD](https://crates.io/crates/walletd) to an existing Rust project, and get started with using its features. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  ⚠️ This project is under heavy development. Expect bugs & breaking changes prior to v1.0.0's release.

## Installing Rust

Rust can be installed by following the instructions on [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) or your choice of package manager. 
Refer to [`the Rust book`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for more guidance on the installation and how to [set up a Rust project directory](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html).
You can set up a new Rust project to try out walletD or incorporate the `walletd` crate into your existing Rust project.

We plan to make our [walletD library](https://docs.rs/walletd/0.1.0/walletd/) available for use on multiple platforms through the use of WASM libraries.

## Install the WalletD Rust Library

It is recommended that the `walletd` crate be installed from the command-line in order to ensure you download the latest version of it.

### Installing via the CLI (recommended)

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'MacOS' }}
cargo add walletd
```

```bash {{ title: 'Windows' }}
cargo add walletd
```

```bash {{ title: 'Linux' }}
cargo add walletd
```

</CodeGroup>

### Installing via the Cargo.toml file

Add the following line to your Cargo.toml file. Make sure you put it under the dependencies heading, then rebuild your project.
