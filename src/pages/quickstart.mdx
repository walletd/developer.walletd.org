# Quickstart

This guide will help you get set up and ready to use the WalletD Rust Library. 
We'll cover how to install Rust, add [walletD](https://crates.io/crates/walletd) to an existing Rust project, and get started with using its features.

## Installing Rust

Rust can be installed using your package manager of choice or [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs). 

Refer to [`the Rust book`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for more guidance on the installation and how to [set up a Rust project directory](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html).


## Install the `WalletD` crate

It is recommended that `WalletD` be installed from the command-line in order to ensure you download the latest version of it.

### Installing via the CLI (recommended)

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'MacOS' }}
cargo add walletd
```

```bash {{ title: 'Windows' }}
cargo add walletd
```

```bash {{ title: 'Linux' }}
cargo add walletd
```

</CodeGroup>

### Installing via the Cargo.toml file

Add the following line to your Cargo.toml file. Make sure you put it under the dependencies heading, then rebuild your project.
```
walletd = "0.1.0"
```


# Quickstart

Let's get you up and started using WalletD. This guide describes how to add [WalletD](https://crates.io/) to an existing Rust project. It assumes that you already have Rust installed, and an existing project you want to use WalletD for. {{ className: 'lead' }}

### Status
<Note>
  ⚠️ This project is under heavy development. Expect bugs & breaking changes prior to v1.0.0's release.

### Next steps

Read through the following example code to get an idea of how simple it is to work with WalletD.

For the most up-to-date examples for the cryptocurrency functionality, please refer to the following folder of [examples on GitHub](non)

## Getting started with Bitcoin

The WalletD team is hard at work polishing up our prepared alpha, and will be adding quickstart documentation for Bitcoin very soon.

## Getting started with Ethereum



### How to query an account balance

```rust
    let eth_client = EthClient::new(&INFURA_GOERLI_ENDPOINT.to_string()).unwrap();
    let address: H160 = "00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72".parse().unwrap();
    let _balance = eth_client.balance(address).await.unwrap();
```    

### How to retrieve a specific block fraom  the Ethereum blockchain
```rust
use walletd_ethereum::EthClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> web3::Result<()> {
    let eth_client = EthClient::new(&INFURA_GOERLI_ENDPOINT.to_string()); // initialise blockchain client

    let block_number = eth_client.current_block_number().await; // retrieve latest block number
    let gas_price = eth_client.gas_price().await; // retrieve current gas price

    println!("Block number: {:#?}", block_number);
    println!("Gas price: {:#?}", gas_price);

    Ok(())
}
```


### How to get a cryptocurrency's block data

```rust
use walletd_ethereum::EthClient;
use walletd_ethereum::
use web3::types::U64;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> web3::Result<()> {
    let eth_client = EthClient::new(&VALID_BLOCKCHAIN_URL.to_string()); // instantiate an instance of EthClient
    let block_number: U64 = U64::from(8455626); // Gets blockchain information for a specified block number


    let latest_block = EthClient::block_data_from_U64(&eth_client, block_number); // Gets the block data for the latest block
    let latest_block_data = EthClient::latest_block(&eth_client); // latest_block_data contains data for an Ethereum block
    Ok(())
}
```
