# Bitcoin

WalletD currently supports using Blockstream to retrieve blockchain information. 

Expanding ways to retrieve this data through other means are part of the WalletD roadmap.

For working with Bitcoin, we recommend the following imports:
```rust 
use walletd_bitcoin::{BitcoinWallet, BitcoinPrivateKey, Network};
use walletd_bitcoin::blockstream::{BTransaction, Input, Output, Status};
```



# Ethereum

## EthClient

## new()

Creates a new instance of a blockchain connector

```rust
  use walletd_ethereum::EthClient;
  use web3::types::U64;
  use walletd_coin_model::BlockchainConnector;
```
```rust
  let endpoint: &str = "https://your-eth-endpoint.com";
  let eth_client = EthClient::new(endpoint).unwrap();  

  let _latest_block_data = EthClient::latest_block(&eth_client);
  Ok(())


```

## block_data_from_U64(&eth_client, block_number);
```rust
let block_number: U64 = U64::from(8455626);
let block_data = EthClient::block_data_from_U64(&eth_client, block_number);
```
