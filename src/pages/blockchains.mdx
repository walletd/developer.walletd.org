## Bitcoin

WalletD currently supports using Blockstream to retrieve blockchain information.

Expanding ways to retrieve this data through other means are part of the WalletD roadmap.

For working with Bitcoin, you can import the following crates and modules:

```rust
use walletd_bitcoin::{BitcoinWallet, BitcoinPrivateKey, Network};
use walletd_bitcoin::blockstream::{BTransaction, Input, Output, Status};
```

## Ethereum

WalletD currently supports any Ethereum endpoint that conforms to the Ethereum JSON-RPC standard for accessing Ethereum blockchain data.

We recommend using [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/pricing). Both services provide generous free plans that you can use.

For working with Ethereum, you can import the following crates and modules:

```rust
use walletd_bip39::{Language, Mnemonic, MnemonicHandler};
use walletd_hd_key::HDNetworkType;
use walletd_ethereum::EthereumWallet;
use walletd_coin_model::{CryptoWallet, CryptoWalletBuilder};
```

### EthClient

Creates a new instance of a blockchain connector. A blockchain connector is used to specify the endpoint of a node one wants to connect to.

### Include these use statements
```rust
  use walletd_ethereum::EthClient;
  use walletd_coin_model::BlockchainConnector;
```
### Example
```rust
  let endpoint: &str = "https://your-eth-endpoint.com";
  let eth_client = EthClient::new(endpoint).unwrap();
```
