# Ethereum Wallet Guide

 Use the EthereumWallet struct as a good starting point to access the functionalities for Ethereum that walletD provides.

 Each EthereumWallet is associated with one public address.
 An EthereumWallet could be instantiated without a EthereumPrivateKey affiliated with it, but it would not be able to sign transactions.
 If an EthereumWallet is created with an EthereumPublicKey but no EthereumPrivateKey, it will be able to verify signatures but not sign or send transactions.

 ## Importing an Ethereum Wallet from an HD Key

 Here's how you can import an Ethereum wallet based on a master [HDKey]. We will use the `mut` keyword to make the [ethereum wallet][EthereumWallet] mutable so that we can modify `ethereum_wallet` later.
 By importing the `ethereum_wallet` fom a `master_hd_key` will both the EthereumPrivateKey and the EthereumPublicKey will be provided to the `ethereum_wallet`.
```rust

 use walletd_ethereum::prelude::*;
 use walletd_hd_key::prelude::*;

 let master_seed = Seed::from_str("a2fd9c0522d84d52ee4c8533dc02d4b69b4df9b6255e1af20c9f1d4d691689f2a38637eb1ec778972bf845c32d5ae83c7536999b5666397ac32021b21e0accee")?;
 let master_hd_key = HDKey::new_master(master_seed, HDNetworkType::TestNet)?;
 let mut ethereum_wallet = EthereumWallet::builder().master_hd_key(master_hd_key).build()?;
 let public_address = ethereum_wallet.public_address();
 println!("ethereum wallet public address: {}", public_address);
 ```

 ## Default Derivation Path

 Deriving an EthereumWallet is simple and uses some default settings under the hood.
 We can inspect our `ethereum_wallet` to see that a child `derived_hd_key` was derived from the master `master_hd_key` and see the derivation path HDPath that was used by default.
```rust

 let derived_hd_key = ethereum_wallet.derived_hd_key()?;
 let address_derivation_path = derived_hd_key.derivation_path;
 println!("address derivation path: {}", address_derivation_path);
 ```
 We see that by default the Ethereum wallet uses the derivation path "m/44'/60'/0'/0/" corresponding to  [BIP44 for the purpose value][HDPurpose::BIP44] and 60' corresponding to the coin type for Ethereum.

 We need to add a [blockchain connector][BlockchainConnector] to our [ethereum wallet][EthereumWallet] to be able to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.


 ## Adding a Blockchain Connector
 Here's an example of how to add an instance of EthClient to our `ethereum_wallet`.
 EthClient currently supports any Ethereum endpoint that conforms to the Ethereum JSON-RPC standard for accessing Ethereum blockchain data.
 We recommend using Infura(https://www.infura.io/), or Alchemy(https://www.alchemy.com/pricing). Both services provide generous free plans that you can use.
 Note that the url used to connect needs to match the network type being used (pay attention to the difference between testnet networks (used for testing and development purposes) and the mainnet network (where coins have actual value).

```rust

  let ethclient_url = "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161";
  let eth_client = EthClient::new(ethclient_url)?;
  ethereum_wallet.set_blockchain_client(eth_client);
 ```

 ## Using EthClient to Access Blockchain Data
 The blockchain client `ethclient` can be used separately from the `ethereum_wallet` to access blockchain data such as details of a transaction given a tx hash, the current block number, or the current gas price.
```rust

 let tx_hash = "0xe4216d69bf935587b82243e68189de7ade0aa5b6f70dd0de8636b8d643431c0b";
 let tx = eth_client.transaction_data_from_hash(tx_hash).await?;
 let block_number = eth_client.current_block_number().await;
 let gas_price = eth_client.gas_price().await;
 println!("transaction data: {:?}", tx);
 ```

 ## Balance of Ethereum Wallet on Blockchain
 When the `ethereum_wallet` is connected to the blockchain, we can find the balance of the wallet.
```rust

 let balance = ethereum_wallet.balance().await?;
 println!("ethereum wallet balance: {} ETH, ({} wei)", balance.eth(), balance.wei());
 ```
