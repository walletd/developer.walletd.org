# Ethereum Wallet

WalletD features the ability to create and work with Ethereum wallets.
In this section, we'll guide you on how to use WalletD to handle Ethereum wallets. {{ className: 'lead' }}

```rust {{ title: 'Imports needed for this section' }}
use walletd::walletd_ethereum::prelude::*;
use walletd::walletd_hd_key::prelude::*;
``` 

 ## Import from Seed

 Here's how you can import an Ethereum wallet based on a master `HDKey`. We will use the `mut` keyword to make the `ethereum_wallet`.
 By importing the `ethereum_wallet` fom a `master_hd_key`, both the `EthereumPrivateKey` and the `EthereumPublicKey` will be provided to the `ethereum_wallet`.

```rust {{ title: 'Example' }}
let master_seed = Seed::from_str("a2fd9c0522d84d52ee4c8533dc02d4b69b4df9b6255e1af20c9f1d4d691689f2a38637eb1ec778972bf845c32d5ae83c7536999b5666397ac32021b21e0accee")?;
let master_hd_key = HDKey::new_master(master_seed, HDNetworkType::TestNet)?;
let mut ethereum_wallet = EthereumWallet::builder().master_hd_key(master_hd_key).build()?;
let public_address = ethereum_wallet.public_address();
println!("ethereum wallet public address: {}", public_address);
```

    href="/mnemonics_guide"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Check out our mnemonics guide for more info on the mnemonic seed"
  />
</div>


<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/hd_key"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Check out our HD Key guide for more info on the HD key"
  />
</div>


 ## Default Derivation Path

 Deriving an `EthereumWallet` is simple and uses some default settings under the hood.
 We can inspect our `ethereum_wallet` to see that a child `derived_hd_key` was derived from the master `master_hd_key` and see the derivation path `HDPath` that was used by default.

```rust {{ title: 'Example' }}
let derived_hd_key = ethereum_wallet.derived_hd_key()?;
let address_derivation_path = derived_hd_key.derivation_path;
println!("address derivation path: {}", address_derivation_path);
```
 We see that by default the Ethereum wallet uses the derivation path "m/44'/60'/0'/0/" corresponding to  BIP44 for the purpose value (`HDPurpose::BIP44`).


 ## Using EthClient

 The `EthClient` struct can be used to access blockchain data through a struct that implements the `BlockchainConnector` trait such as `EthClient`.
 The `EthClient` instance can be used on its own to access blockchain data such as the current block number and the gas price.
 It can be affiliated with a `EthereumWallet` to enable the `EthereumWallet` to access blockchain data and send transactions.

 `EthClient` currently supports any Ethereum endpoint that conforms to the Ethereum JSON-RPC standard for accessing Ethereum blockchain data.
 We recommend using Infura(https://www.infura.io/), or Alchemy(https://www.alchemy.com/pricing). Both services provide generous free plans that you can use.
 Note that the url used to connect needs to match the network type being used (pay attention to the difference between testnet networks (used for testing and development purposes) and the mainnet network (where coins have actual value)).

Here's an example of creating an instance of `EthClient`.

```rust {{ title: 'Example' }}
let ethclient_url = "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161";
let eth_client = EthClient::new(ethclient_url)?;
```
 
The blockchain client `ethclient` can be used separately from the `ethereum_wallet` to access blockchain data such as details of a transaction given a tx hash, the current block number, or the current gas price.

```rust {{ title: 'Example' }}
let tx_hash = "0xe4216d69bf935587b82243e68189de7ade0aa5b6f70dd0de8636b8d643431c0b";
let tx = eth_client.transaction_data_from_hash(tx_hash).await?;
let block_number = eth_client.current_block_number().await;
let gas_price = eth_client.gas_price().await;
println!("transaction data: {:?}", tx);
```

We can associate the `ethclient` with the `ethereum_wallet` using the `set_blockchain_client` method.

```rust 
ethereum_wallet.set_blockchain_client(eth_client);
```

## Check Balance
When the `ethereum_wallet` is connected to the blockchain, we can find the balance of the wallet as well as access other functions such as `transfer` required for the `CryptoWallet` trait.

```rust {{ title: 'Example' }}
let balance = ethereum_wallet.balance().await?;
println!("ethereum wallet balance: {} ETH, ({} wei)", balance.eth(), balance.wei());
```
